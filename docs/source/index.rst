.. Full stack Django starter site

Welcome to Django Full Stack Kit!
=================================

`Django Full Stack Kit`_ is a full stack application built to serve as a starter kit and provide many examples on
configuring Django for growth.

There are some tools and technologies used by this kit that are not an ideal match for all teams such as using Ansible over Chef.
The goal here is to provide enough information that a team can swap out with their preferred tools to match their teams
strengths.

Overall, if you are new to full stack development this kit will have everything you need for managing a website for
a new start up.
